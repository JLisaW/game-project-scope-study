-   A wireframe of what your game project will look like.

-   The data structure you plan to use.

    I plan on using arrays to represent the gameboard.  Players will need an email and password to login or sign-up. I will use the API Token Authorization material to create a token and id number.  The scoreboard will be a loop and the game status (win/lose) will be a boolean.

-   How you will take the markup of the game board and represent it in JS

    I'm not sure I understand the question.

- How you plan to approach this project.

    I plan to take the suggestions given in the Game Project.  I will be methodical and set daily goals to accomplish.  Starting with the wireframe and user stories I will be able to have a better idea of what I want as part of the game.  Then I will start with creating the JS logic to make the game work and then create the front-end with HTML and CSS.

-   4-8 user stories for your game project.

    As a user, I want to be able to log in so that I can keep my score.
    As a user, I want to be able to sign-up so that I can play.
    As a user, I want to be able to start a new game so that I can play.
    As a user, I want to be able to log out so that I can play again later.

-   How you plan to keep your code modular.

    I plan on keeping my code modular by saving each functionality in separate files.

-   What creative spin will you add to your project?

    I want to try to add a timer and hints to my game.  When the player hovers over certain boxes it will turn green if it is a suggested move.

-   How will you use version control to backup / track your project?

    I will commit often and write informative commit messages.

-   Do you plan to attempt any of the bonuses?

    I would like to attempt the bonuses, ideally I would like to use styling as part of my creative spin.

You may want to submit pictures for your wireframes and/or user stories.
